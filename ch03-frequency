Chapter(Wait times and Frequency)

N2D(Wait until a success~~negbinom~~
one Binomial (coin-flip) draw per period. What is the likelihood that we will have to wait
before we observe $k$ successes?

)

N2D(Events per period~~poisson~~
Independent events (rainy day, landmine, bad data) occur at the
mean rate of $\lambda$ events per span (of time, space, et cetera). What is the
probability that there will be $t$ events in a single span?
~~
Poisson$(t, \lambda)$
