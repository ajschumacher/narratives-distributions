N2D(Wait until one success~~geometric~~
One Ref(Bernoulli~~bernie) (coin-flip) draw per period. What is the likelihood that the
first event will occur at period $x$? Citep(goswami:rao~~p 9)

N2D(Wait until $k$ successes~~negbinom~~
One Ref(Bernoulli~~bernie) (coin-flip) draw per period. What is the likelihood that we will have to wait
$x$ draws before we observe $k$ successes?

N2D(Markov chain stabilization~~markovgeometric~~

A system is represented by a column vector of states ${\bf S}$, which
changes states according to a Markov matrix $P$. What is the likelihood that it
will take $t$ steps to reach a steady state, where ${\bf S}_{t+1} = {\bf S}_t\cdot P = {\bf S}_t$?
~~
The Markov Geometric Distribution,
$$MGD(R, Q, t)={\bf 1}'(I-tR)^{-1}(tQ){\bf 1},$$
where $Q$ is the diagonal matrix matching the diagonal of $P$, $R$ is the
off-diagonal of $P$ (so $R=P-Q$), ${\bf 1}$ is an appropriately-sized column vector of ones,
and $I$ and appropriately-sized identity matrix.

N2D(Events per period~~poisson~~
Independent events (rainy day, landmine, bad data) occur at the
mean rate of $\lambda$ events per span (of time, space, et cetera). What is the
probability that there will be $t$ events in a single span?

Poisson$(\lambda, t)$

Section(Continuous)

N2D(Wait until a success~~eponential~~
Events occur via a Ref(Poisson~~poisson) process ($\lambda$ events per time/space span).
What is the likelihood that the first event will occur within $x$ periods?
~~
Exponential$(\lambda, x)$
)

N2D(Wait until $k$ successes~~gamma~~
Events are a Ref(Poisson~~poisson) process: $\lambda$ events per time period. What is the
likleihood that we will observe $x$ events in a span of $k$ time units?

Spatial version: $\lambda$ events per spatial unit. What is the likelihood that we observe $x$ events over a distance or area of $k$ units?
~~
Gamma$(k, \lambda, x)$
)

N2D(<|Wait until a success, but time scale is not even or success odds change|>~~weibull~~
Events occur via a Ref(Poisson~~poisson)-like process ($\lambda$ events per time/space span), 
so the likelihood of observing an event within $x$ periods is Exponential$(\lambda, x)$.
But the time scale is distorted, so $y=x^{1/\gamma}$. [Note that an additive or
multiplicative distortion would still give us an Exponential Distribution.]

Another way to describe this is that the event rate is  changing with time. If $\gamma > 1$,
events are more likely after some time. If $\gamma < 1$, events are more likely to occur early.
