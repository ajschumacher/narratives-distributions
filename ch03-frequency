Chapter(Wait times and frequency)

N2D(Wait until a success--discrete~~negbinom~~
One Ref(Bernoulli~~bernie) (coin-flip) draw per period. What is the likelihood that we will have to wait
$x$ draws before we observe $k$ successes?
~~

)

N2D(Wait until a success--continuous~~eponential~~
Events occur via a Ref(Poisson~~poisson) process ($\lambda$ events per time/space span).
What is the likelihood that the first event will occur within $x$ periods?
~~
Exponential$(\lambda)(x)$
)

N2D(Wait until $k$ successes--continuous~~gamma~~
Events are a Ref(Poisson~~poisson) process: $\lambda$ events per time period. What is the
likleihood that we will observe $x$ events in a span of $k$ time units?

Spatial version: $\lambda$ events per spatial unit. What is the likelihood that we observe $x$ events over a distance or area of $k$ units?
~~
Gamma$(k, \lambda)(x)$
)

Comment(
N2D(Wait until a success, but success odds change~~weibull~~
Events occur via a Ref(Poisson~~poisson)-like process ($\lambda$ events per time/space span), but the rate $\lambda$ changes with time.
What is the likelihood that the first event will occur within $x$ periods?
~~
Exponential$(\lambda)(x)$
)
)

N2D(Events per period~~poisson~~
Independent events (rainy day, landmine, bad data) occur at the
mean rate of $\lambda$ events per span (of time, space, et cetera). What is the
probability that there will be $t$ events in a single span?
~~
Poisson$(\lambda)(x)$
