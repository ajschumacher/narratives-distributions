N2D(Draws from a binary option ~~bernie~~
The coin-flip: one event occurs with probability $p$.
~~
This is the Bernoulli distribution, which is one with probability $p$ and zero with
probability $1-p$. The variance of a Bernoulli distribution is $p(1-p)$.
)

N2D(Multiple draws from a binary option ~~binom~~
Draw $N$ events with probability $p$.
~~
The Binomial$(N, p)$ distribution.
The mean is $Np$ and the variance is $Np(1-p)$.
)


N2D(Mean of iid observations ~~clt~~
Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Take the mean of those draws. The mean of the draws 
~~
As $N\to\infty$, the distribution of repeated means will be a Normal distribution, with mean $\mu=\sum x/N$ and $\sigma = \sum (x-\mu)^2/N$.
