Chapter(Intro)


This project lists open-form narratives and the closed-form distributions that
approximate them. Its intent is to help you build estimable statistical models on a sound
micro-level foundation.


Here is a simple example of going from a real-world situation to an estimable mathematical model:

N2D(A sample narrative~~samp~~
Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Take the mean of those draws.
~~
The distribution of repeated means will be a Normal distribution.
)

If you wanted to write a simulation, in which individual agents each experience some iid
shock and their mean level is measured and reported, this wonderful piece of mathematics
just saved you the trouble.

Now you can focus your energeies on the more novel parts of the storyline. Of course,
those too may have closed-form shortcuts that save you the trouble of writing down an
open-form simulation. Your final model may wind up being a combination of closed-form
submodels.

This project is an index of narratives that have closed-form equivalents, intended to help
users develop their 

Little, if any, of this is novel, and every narrative-to-distribution should have a
reference to an existing work, (including Wikipedia, because this is uncontroversial,
textbook stuff). However, it is being presented in what seems to be a novel way, to
facilitate the development of detailed micro-level narratives using known bulding
blocks where they are available.

The fact that we are relying on so many existing sources means that we don't need to
provide proofs here, unless they are useful for elucidating the transformation.

Also, estimation is often not a trivial matter. Some of these examples may break for
small $N$. We may add these notes later, but at this stage it would be nice to just get
down as many narratives as possible, and leave the estimation details to the references.
