     <h1>A Table of Narratives and Generated Distributions</h1>


<P>
This project lists open-form narratives and the closed-form distributions that
approximate them. Its intent is to help you build estimable statistical models on a sound
micro-level foundation.</p>

<p>Here is a simple example of going from a real-world situation to an estimable mathematical model:</p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="samp"></a><h6>A sample narrative</h6><p>
        
Narrative: Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Take the mean of those draws.</p>

<p>Distribution: The distribution of repeated means will be a Normal distribution.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p>If you wanted to write a simulation, in which individual agents each experience some iid
shock and their mean level is measured and reported, this wonderful piece of mathematics
just saved you the trouble.</p>

<p>Now you can focus your energeies on the more novel parts of the storyline. Of course,
those too may have closed-form shortcuts that save you the trouble of writing down an
open-form simulation. Your final model may wind up being a combination of closed-form
submodels.</p>

<p>This project is an index of narratives that have closed-form equivalents, intended to help
users develop their </p>

<p>Little, if any, of this is novel, and every narrative-to-distribution should have a
reference to an existing work, (including Wikipedia, because this is uncontroversial,
textbook stuff). However, it is being presented in what seems to be a novel way, to
facilitate the development of detailed micro-level narratives using known bulding
blocks where they are available.</p>

<p>The fact that we are relying on so many existing sources means that we don't need to
provide proofs here, unless they are useful for elucidating the transformation.</p>

<p>Also, estimation is often not a trivial matter. Some of these examples may break for
small $N$. We may add these notes later, but at this stage it would be nice to just get
down as many narratives as possible, and leave the estimation details to the references.</p>

<h1>Aggregation</h1><p></p>

<p><h2>Central Limit Theorems</h2><p></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="bernie"></a><h6>Draws from a binary option </h6><p>
        
Narrative: The coin-flip: one event occurs with probability $p$.</p>

<p>Distribution: This is the Bernoulli distribution, which is one with probability $p$ and zero with
probability $1-p$. The variance of a Bernoulli distribution is $p(1-p)$.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="binom"></a><h6>Multiple draws from a binary option </h6><p>
        
Narrative: Draw $N$ events with probability $p$.</p>

<p>Distribution: The Binomial$(N, p)$ distribution.
The mean is $Np$ and the variance is $Np(1-p)$.</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="clt"></a><h6>Mean of iid observations </h6><p>
        
Narrative: Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Report the mean of those draws.</p>

<p>Distribution: As $N\to\infty$, the distribution of repeated means will be a Normal distribution, with mean $\mu=\sum x/N$ and $\sigma = \sum (x-\mu)^2/N$.

<h1>Wait times and frequency</h1><p></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="negbinom"></a><h6>Wait until a success</h6><p>
        
Narrative: One <a href="#bernie">Bernoulli</a> (coin-flip) draw per period. What is the likelihood that we will have to wait
before we observe $k$ successes?</p>

<p>Distribution: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution">Negative binomial</a>$(k, p)$</p>

<p></div></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="poisson"></a><h6>Events per period</h6><p>
        
Narrative: Independent events (rainy day, landmine, bad data) occur at the
mean rate of $\lambda$ events per span (of time, space, et cetera). What is the
probability that there will be $t$ events in a single span?</p>

<p>Distribution: Poisson$(t, \lambda)$</p>

<p></div></p>

<h1>Order statistics</h1><p></p>

<p><div class="h2d"><a name="betafromuniform"></a><h6>The $N$th largest draw from a Uniform</h6><p>
        
Narrative: The first <em>order statistic</em> of a set of numbers $x$ is the smallest number in the
set; the second is the next-to-smallest, up to the largest order statistic, which
is $\max(x)$.</p>

<p>The $\alpha+\beta-1$ elements of $x$ are drawn from a Uniform$[0, 1]$ distribution.</p>

<p>Distribution: The $\alpha$th order statistic has a Beta$(\alpha,\beta)$ distribution.</p>
