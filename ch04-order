Chapter(Order statistics)

N2D(The $N$th largest draw from a Uniform~~betafromuniform~~
The first em(order statistic) of a set of numbers $x$ is the smallest number in the
set; the second is the next-to-smallest, up to the largest order statistic, which
is $\max(x)$.

The $\alpha+\beta-1$ elements of $x$ are drawn from a Uniform$[0, 1]$ Distribution.
~~
Let $a$ be the possible values of the $\alpha$th order statistic; then $a$ has a Beta$(\alpha,\beta, a)$ Distribution.
