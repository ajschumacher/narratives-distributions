N2D(Draws from a binary option ~~bernie~~
The coin-flip: one event occurs with probability $p$.
~~
This defines the Bernoulli Distribution, which is one with probability $p$ and zero with
probability $1-p$.
~~
The variance of a Bernoulli Distribution is $p(1-p)$.
)

N2D(Multiple draws from a binary option ~~binom~~
Draw $N$ events with probability $p$.
~~
The Binomial$(N, p)$ Distribution.
~~
The mean is $Np$ and the variance is $Np(1-p)$.
)

N2D(Draws from a more-than-binary option ~~bernie~~
The die-roll: each observation is from a list of possible outcomes, each with its own
probability of occurring, ${\bf p} = [p_1, p_2, ..., p_k]$. Exactly one event happens each time, so 
$\sum_{i=1}^k p_i = 1$. We make $n$ draws. What is the $k$-dimensional vector of observed
outcomes?
~~
Multinomial$(n, {\bf p})$.
)

N2D(Draws without replacement ~~negbinom~~
Start with a pool of $s$ successes and $f$ failures, so $N=s+f$, and the Bernoulli $p=s/N$.
What are the odds that we get $x$ successes from $n$ draws without replacement?
~~
Negative binomial$(s, f, n, x)$
)

N2D(Draws with super-replacement ~~betabinom~~
[The PÃ³lya urn scheme] Start with a pool of $\alpha$ red and $\beta$ black balls. Draw a ball, note its color,
then return it and a duplicate to the urn (so if you draw a white ball, put that and
another white ball back). Repeat $n$ times, report the count of white balls.
~~
Beta-binomial$(n, \alpha, \beta, x)$
~~
This is the posterior distribution from updating with a Beta distribution and a Binomial likelihood.

N2D(Mean of univariate iid observations ~~clt~~
Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Report the mean of those draws.
~~
As $N\to\infty$, the distribution of repeated means will be a Normal Distribution, with mean $\mu=\sum x/N$ and $\sigma = \sum (x-\mu)^2/N$.

N2D(Product of univariate iid observations ~~clt~~
Begin with a value $x$.
Make a large series of independent, identically distributed (iid) draws from a source.
Report the product, $x\cdot d_1 \cdot d_2 ...$.
~~
As $N\to\infty$, the distribution of products will be a Lognormal Distribution, with
mean $\mu=\ln(x) +(\sum_i \ln(d_i))/N$ and $\sigma = \sum_i (\ln(d_i)-\mu)^2/N$. That
is, the log of the products will be Normally distributed, and $\mu$ and $\sigma$
indicate the mean and standard deviation of the log.  Citep(klemens:modeling)

N2D(Orthogonal components are Normally distributed ~~rayleigh~~
On one axis, we have a series of iid draws, which generates a ${\cal N}(0, \sigma)$
distribution. On an orthogonal axis, another series of iid draws also generates a ${\cal N}(0, \sigma)$ distribution.
The observed scalar output $x$ is the magnitude of the resulting vector ($x=\sqrt{d_1^2+d_2^2}$).
